# grade-tracker
Calculate and update your university grades on a webpage.
Visualise where effort is best placed to achieve target grades.
To be fair grade tracking is kind of obsessive and toxic so I actually do not endorse my own
project. But it saves me time calculating my averages which I'm inevitably going to do anyway
after working hard on assignments \-_-/ .
